           <p>Penney's game, named after its inventor Walter Penney, is a binary sequence generating game between two players.
               Player A selects a sequence of heads and tails of length 3 and then Player B also selects a sequence of heads and tails of length 3.
               Then a fair coin is tossed until either player A's or player B's sequence appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin toss outcomes.
               The player whose sequence appears first wins.
           </p>

            <p>
                There are eight sequences can be chosen in total. By choosing each of them, you can see that there is always a sequence chosen by the computer
                that can beat the player's choice. This is because Penney's game is a non-transitive game. There is NO best options in such a game. Given a sequence,
                one can always find another sequence that has a higher chance of occuring first. A similar game is known as "Rock Paper Scissors".
